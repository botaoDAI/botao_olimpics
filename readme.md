What I plan to do in the next three years:
- have more cats
- take care of the cats of my neighbor
    -my neighbor has no cat actually
    -she has a dog
- take care of her dog

A well-known one: $E=mc^2$ 

```python
# This is a python exemple
def greet(name):
    print(f"hello,{name})!")

greet("world")
````
A bash code:
```bash
ls -a
```
